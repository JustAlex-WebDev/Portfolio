## About
I'm Alexandar. A web developer, designer and problem solver.

The cusp of art and technology has always fascinated me and I've never been afraid to just jump in and give it a go, whether it's Javascript, CSS, Firebase or Figma. Iâ€™ve been developing and designing websites since the day I first bought my computer.

What excites me most about being a Web Developer is being able to develope and design things that have purpose and solve real problems. It goes beyond designing buttons and websites and involves having a passion for designing experiences and solutions that help people, whether it's helping them market themselves online, or buy something online. Leaning into customer insight and understanding their needs, finding the right problems to solve, delivering solutions as quickly as possible, learning from those and then iterating and improving that value over time is the key to great web developer.
