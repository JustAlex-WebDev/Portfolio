## About

I'm Alexandar, a web developer, designer, and problem solver.

The intersection of art and technology has always fascinated me. Whether it's JavaScript, CSS, Firebase, or Figma, I’ve never hesitated to dive in and explore. I’ve been developing and designing websites since the day I first bought my computer.

What excites me most about being a Web Developer is the ability to create and design solutions that have a real purpose and solve real problems. It goes beyond designing buttons and websites; it's about crafting experiences that help people, whether it’s assisting them in marketing themselves online or facilitating online purchases. Understanding customer insights, identifying the right problems to solve, delivering swift solutions, learning from them, and iterating to improve over time is the essence of being a great web developer.
